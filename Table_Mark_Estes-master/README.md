# Table_Mark_Estes
Mark Este's Table code modified to work with just a matrix

#define BESTPATTERNS lets you see some of my favourite patterns given that the whole list is
otherwise 113 patterns long :)

Via the arduino serial port, turn off line endings, and use 'n' and 'p' to change patterrns 
or send '80' to jump to pattern 80 directly.
